# CDlogs REST API!
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Background:
I come from the Commercial Diving industry, i retired about 2 years ago to become a developer and this is a project that ive done multiple times using different frameworks. call it my take on the ubiquitous TO-DO app... this time, using Typescript and Express Framework. 

this is a RESTful API that im creating to provide functionality to a Commercial Diving Logs web service... 

Commercial Diving logs or "logbooks" as we call them in the industry, are very tedious paperback records of every dive one does in a professional context. these logs are Legal documents and contain all information about the dive including:

1.- Safety considerations
2.- Diving procedures
3.- Weather Conditions
4.- Professional Context (contractors and client company names, location, deployment platforms)
5.- Equipment testing data
6.- Relevant personnel Data

i hope that in the future this web service can help my former colleagues to increase their documental control capabilities as i believe these are the cornerstone of Safety procedures in the offshore industry.

whats in the package?

1.- source code
2.- an exported json file with all the queries and raw JSON so you can import it using Insomnia or Postman or whatevever.

use environment variables for port and MONGO_URI to connect to your database, i use MongoDB Atlas! 

i will be dockerizing the whole thing in the future.
