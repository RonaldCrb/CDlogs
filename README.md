TS-Node-Mongo-REST-API

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

this is another experiment where im learning typescript nuances while comparing its syntax with my other node apps.

here ive used the middleware approach ( no MVC, just models and middlewares) to create a JWT authentication flow 
and serve data from MongoDB Atlas. this app also is going to handle E-commerce endpoints that are going to be consumed 
by a Nuxt app.
